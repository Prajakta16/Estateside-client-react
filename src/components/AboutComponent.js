            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>
                This project is made as a part of the course CS5610 Web Development at Northeastern
                University.
            </p>

                The objective of the project is to make a property rental application
                that would allow users to interactively search properties in the selected area,
                inspect the different aspects associated with a property like the property type,
                amenities, parking etc. as well as express their interest in a particular property
                by contacting the associated property advertiser.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are using Zillowâ€™s public APIs. Zillow has a variety of apartment options to buy, sell and rent. The
                Web API endpoints return JSON metadata about the apartments located in a particular location based on
                REST principles. We will use the web API to provide search details based on various filters.
            </p>
